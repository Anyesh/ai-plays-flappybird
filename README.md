# AI Plays Flappy Bird

I've trained a DQN that learns to play flappy bird on it's own.

## Try the pre-trained model

First install the pip requirements and run `main.py` to see how our agent plays flappy bird.

## Train the model

If you want to train this model on your own, just change to `agent.train()` in `main.py` file and you are good to go. You can see the progress on the console displayed using `rich`.
